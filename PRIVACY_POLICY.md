1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Click! (“the Software”) handles data when you download, install, or use it.

Click! is an offline-first, open-source desktop application designed to capture screenshots and clipboard content locally on your device for documentation purposes.

We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency.

2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Click! does not collect, transmit, store, or share any of the following:

❌ Personal information (name, email, address, phone number)

❌ Usage analytics or telemetry

❌ Screenshots, images, or clipboard data remotely

❌ Keystrokes or background activity logs

❌ Device identifiers

❌ Location data

❌ Advertising identifiers

❌ Cookies or tracking technologies

3. Information Processed Locally

Click! may process the following locally on your device only:

Screenshots of your screen (triggered manually by you)

Clipboard contents (only at the moment you press the capture hotkey)

File paths and filenames you choose or that are auto-generated

Active window titles (for labeling documentation)

👉 All processing happens entirely on your local machine.
👉 No data is sent outside your device.

4. Data Storage

All captured data is saved locally to a folder you control.

By default:
C:\Users\[YourName]\Documents\Click! Captures\

You may delete, move, or manage these files at any time.

Click! does not maintain any background databases or hidden storage.

5. Internet & Network Access

Click! does not require an internet connection to function.

Click! does not connect to external servers.

Click! does not perform background network communication.

If you download the Software from GitHub or the Microsoft Store, those platforms may collect data independently under their own privacy policies.

6. Third-Party Components

Click! uses open-source third-party libraries (such as Python, CustomTkinter, Pillow, python-docx, and Windows APIs).

These libraries operate locally within the application.

Click! does not enable any data-sharing features of third-party components.

Each third-party library is governed by its own license.

7. Microsoft Store Compliance Notice

For users downloading Click! from the Microsoft Store:

Click! complies with Microsoft Store privacy requirements.

The application does not collect or transmit personal data.

No account sign-in, telemetry, or advertising SDKs are used.

Any data collected by Microsoft (e.g., download statistics) is governed by Microsoft’s Privacy Statement, not by Click!.

8. Open-Source Transparency

Click! is open-source software.

The full source code is publicly available.

Transparency is a core design principle.
